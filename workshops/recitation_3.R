# Questions for Recitation 3


# The cost of a component varies depending on market conditions.
# Over the last year, analysts report is cost on average $50, 
# with a standard deviation of $5.

# What is the probability the component will cost exactly $60?


# What is the probability the component costs less than $60?


# What is the probability that the component costs more than $60?

# What price is greater than 75% of all sales?


# What is the probability it costs between $45 and $55?




# Q2. You're developing a new medical device for measuring blood sugar. You might test "High" (T = 1) vs. "Fine" (0), and you might *actually* be "High" (R = 1) or "Fine" (0) 

# Given that you tested "High", what's the probability that your blood sugar is *actually* "High"?
# Fortunately, you collected the crosstable.
# Here's your data.

# 4 people really were "High" when they tested "High".
# 6 people really were "High" when they tested "Fine".
# 5 people really were "Fine" when they tested "Fine".
# 3 people really were "Fine" when they tested "High".

# Find the probability P(R=1|T=1), and use this empirical data to PROVE that Bayes Rule works.
